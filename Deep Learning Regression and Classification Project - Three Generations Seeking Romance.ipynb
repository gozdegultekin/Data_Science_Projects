    "In this project, we utilize the ‘profiles’ dataset, which contains 60,000 anonymized entries from the OKCupid dating platform, to predict users’ ages as well as their generational cohorts (Baby Boomers, Generation X, Millennials/Generation Y). Due to the large size of the dataset, age prediction will be performed using a deep learning–based regression model, while generation prediction will be carried out using a deep learning–based classification model. The predictive performance of both models will then be evaluated.\n",
